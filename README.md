🕵️ Criminal Hotspots Prediction System & Dashboard
<br><br>
🔍 A Crime Probability Prediction App with Data Visualization
<br><br>
This project is a combination of Python (Tkinter GUI + Machine Learning) and Power BI, built to predict and visualize potential criminal hotspots based on user-input and historical behavioral data.
<br>
💡 Project Overview
<br>
The system allows users to input attributes such as:
<br>
Age, Gender, Area
<br>
Number of prior arrests
<br>
Crime severity rating
<br>
Distance from police station
<br>
Number of nearby CCTVs
<br>
Location risk level
<br>
Using this data, the app applies Logistic Regression (via scikit-learn) to compute the probability of criminal activity for a particular region or individual profile.
